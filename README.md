Using Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning to play Quarto
============
The system allows the user to enter the agent-type for two players. 
The possible agent types are:

1. Human - the computer receives commands regarding board locations and quarto pieces from a real person.

2. Random - choose locations and pieces completely at random.

3. Novice - as described above.

4. Minimax D - where D is the maximum depth that minimax with alpha-beta pruning will search.
